I"i<p>Java 8 since its release in 2014 has become the most widely adopted java version being used by over 80% of Java applications, it has become the default version to which legacy applications are usually updated to. The reason it is Java8 is usually because version 7 has reached its EOL but uprdate to version 9 is too big of a step that teams would like to take. But even when team are updating to Java8 or writing a new app using it rareley do they use the new features of the version. This stems from the fact that why fix anything which is not broken.</p>

<p>As much as I want to disagree, that is the harsh reality of things, I say harsh  because newer versions come with some awesome features.Even though legacy applications now a days have been updated to Java8 as a defacto version, teams usually dont use the new features. This article aims to educate people on what benifits these features provide as a way to give them a reson to try using the new features for development.</p>
