I"<<p>Java 8 since its release in 2014 has become the most widely adopted java version being used by over 80% of Java applications, it has become the default version to which legacy applications are usually updated to. The reason it is Java8 is usually because version 7 has reached its EOL but upgrading to version 9 is too big of a step that companies would like to take. But even when team are updating to Java8 or writing a new app using it rareley do they even use the new features of the version. This stems from the fact that why fix anything which is not broken.</p>
