I"Ë<p>It has been little over an year since I started my career with a software Job. As it is with most software jobs there are things that you can only learn and understand when you get your hands dirty. So in the past one year as a junior developer I got a chance to work with various technologies about which I had no clue of. I will try to share my understanding about these technologies/ topics through these posts so that they donâ€™t go undocumented.</p>
