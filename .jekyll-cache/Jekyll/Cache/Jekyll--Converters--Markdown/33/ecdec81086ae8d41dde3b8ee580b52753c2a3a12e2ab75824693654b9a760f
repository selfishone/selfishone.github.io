I"I<p>Anyone who has worked as a Java developer or engineer knows that most of the Legacy applications are stuck with the version 8 of Java since its release in 2014, even though more newer versions till 13 have been released by oracle, companies rarely try to adopt them. More on it for another article but, even whey they really do update the version, rarely do they even try to refactor their code to make use of the new features. The reason behind this usually stems from the fact that why fix anything which is not broken.</p>

<p>As much as I want to disagree, that is the harsh reality of things, I say harsh  because newer versions come with some awesome features.Even though legacy applications now a days have been updated to Java8 as a defacto version, teams usually dont tend to use the new features. This article aims to educate people on what benifits these features provide as a way to give them a reson to try using the new features for development.</p>
